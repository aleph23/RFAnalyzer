    Received data port:     UDP 48247
    Control listener port:  UDP 48248
    Transmit data port:     UDP 48249

Data format:
    LSB 0
    Little endian

Control frame:
    [0:1]  'St'
    [2:5]  Rx tune phase
    [6:9]  Tx tune phase
    [10]   Tx output level 0 to 255
    [11]   Tx control bits:
                0x01 Enable CW transmit
                0x02 Enable all other transmit
                0x04 Use the HiQSDR extended IO pins not present in the 2010 QEX ver 1.0
                0x08 The key is down (software key)
    [12]   Rx control bits
           Second stage decimation less one, 1-39, six bits
    [13]   zero or firmware version number
           The above is used for firmware version 1.0; add eight more
           bytes for version 1.1:
    [14]   X1 connector: Preselect pins 69, 68, 65, 64;
           Preamp pin 63, Tx LED pin 57
    [15]   Attenuator pins 84, 83, 82, 81, 80
    [16]   More bits: AntSwitch pin 41 is 0x01
           Remaining five bytes are sent as zero.
           For version 1.2 include the VNA scan count:
    [17:21] Unused (0x00).

Receiving interface:
    1. Send "rr" to device
    2. Read frames:
        [0]     packet serial number
        [1]     status
        [2:1442] IQ samples (I3 I2 I1 Q3 Q2 Q1) 240 times
    3. send "ss" to stop receiving data
